# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project we have used Jupyter notebook,Pandas Library ,Python citypy module ,Python requests ,API and JSON Traversals to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world.

We then analyzed the data using pandas and plot the data using the matplotlib library and google maps API. Finally, we performed a statical analysis with the scipy library. The end result is a series of plots that visually and statically shows the relationship between the latitude and a variety of weather parameters.

PlanMyTrip is a travel technology company that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry.
Collect and present data to customers via the search page which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. 

To Perform this task, we have used a Jupyter notebook and the citypy Module to get the cities for more than 500 random latitudes and longitudes.
Then we performed requests on the open weather map API and retrieve the JSON weather data from these cities. The weather data is added to a pandaâ€™s library and used a matplotlib to create a series of scatter plots to show the relationship btw latitude and variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world.

As part of analysis, we performed statistical analysis on the data using the linear regression on the weather parameters in the northern and southern hemispheres.
This data has helped the team predict the best time of the year for people to plan a vacation.
I have exported the data cleaned it and uses the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria.
I have also mapped these cities using the jupyter gmaps and google places API.
As an improvement have added the weather description to the weather data. Then, used the input statements to filter the data for the weather preferences, later used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
